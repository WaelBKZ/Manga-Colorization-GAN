# Manga-Colorization-GAN
[Project from May 2020]

Generative Adversarial Network implemented for coloring black&amp;white manga images.

The object of this ML project is the colorization of an image, initially in black and white, using an algorithm trained by supervised learning. The final goal is, given a manga page (*note*: manga pages are almost always in black and white), to obtain the most faithful colorization possible.

We used a data set composed of about 10 000 images, from *Kaggle*.
